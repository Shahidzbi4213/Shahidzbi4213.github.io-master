The generation gap between Generation Z (date of birth after 1995) and previous generations is especially prevalent when it comes to communication technology. Communication technologies have undergone drastic changes from 2000 to 2016, from the initial popularity of cell phones, to the eventual dependence on smart phones, to the popularity of instant messaging, to the journey of social media fads (think MySpace, Facebook, and Instagram), to new innovative ways to communicate (such as 10-second Snapchat messages). Members of Generation Z have grown up in the midst of all of this, and have been exposed to all different types of communication technologies from a very young age. Once these members grow up and become adults, they will need to interact with members from other generations, such as in the workforce. 

This brings up questions such as: How do generations differ in preferred communication technologies? How do generations differ in who they feel comfortable communicating with over certain platforms? How do generations differ in communication patterns and norms? What kind of conflicts might these differences cause? Based off this information, what kinds of future communication technologies can be created to appeal to the current population? In order to attempt to address these questions, a small empirical survey study was conducted on participants with ages ranging from 14 (Generation Z) to 55 (Baby Boomers). Results show some clear differences in communication technology use between age groups. These results suggest that younger generations may have some conflict communicating with older generations due to differences in what it considered to be socially acceptable. In the workplace, communication rules and guidelines would help to set specific boundaries. The results also suggest that future communication technologies should focus more on a connected presence rather than an active presence. 

The results of this pilot study currently cannot be published due to minor participant privacy reasons. I am currently working on a published version of this study.
