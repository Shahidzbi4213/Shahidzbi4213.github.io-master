This sundial application was created by a team of three undergraduate software engineering students in 2013. This web application allows users to enter the desired date (using a date picker), location (it auto-generates the coordinates), and whether daylight savings should be activated or not. The application then generates an image of the sundial and gnomon, of the correct dimensions for these particular conditions. The user can then follow the instructions to print and cut out the images and paste them together to create their accurate sundial.

The code was divided into three parts: web design, calculations, and the drawing of the sundial. For this particular project, I focused on the drawing of the sundial, but in an earlier version, I coded the calculations as well. Both the drawing and the calculations are coded in Javascript.

By completing the project, I learned a few of the difficulties and conveniences of programming as a group using version control. I learned that communication is key, otherwise code will be written and rewritten more than it needs to be. I gained my first self-taught skills in Javascript, and I learned how a sundial actually works!
